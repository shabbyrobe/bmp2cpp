## Expectation Management

This was put together as a fun experiment for my own amusement. It is not a
product, and comes with no guarantee of support or API stability, nor indeed
any guarantee at all that it even works. Issues may be responded to on an
ad-hoc basis, but pull requests are unlikely to be accepted.
